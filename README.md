# San-Francisco-Opera-Orchestra

First freelance project after graduating from Trilogy Education Services Web Development Bootcamp. This is a website built for San Francisco Opera Orchestra. The client came to me asking for a new site from scratch. After deliberation, the website was abandoned, and the site was built using Wix.
